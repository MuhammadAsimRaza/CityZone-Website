            <b>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has revealed the extent of Erling Haaland’s injury that forced him to be withdrawn at half-time of the 6-1 win over Bournemouth.</b>
            <p>It proved to be a routine afternoon’s work for the reigning Premier League champions, who further extended their winning run following the most recent international break by dismissing of Andoni Iraola’s side in comfortable fashion.</p>
            <p>Three goals either side of half-time gave the south coast club next to no chance of mounting a charge for points on the afternoon, as a Jeremy Doku-inspired victory showed a gulf in class between the Premier League champions and division strugglers.</p>
        
            <p>The Belgian international had his hand in five of the six goals on the afternoon, providing a staggering total of four assists and scoring a goal of his own.</p>

<p>However, concerns over the fitness of Erling Haaland dominated conversation at the interval, and into the post-match.</p>

<p>The Norwegian forward was withdrawn at the half-time break by Pep Guardiola on the guidance of club medical staff, with Phil Foden – who would go on to score in the second-half – coming on in his place.</p>

<p>Speaking to the media after the match, Pep Guardiola provided further insight into the reasoning behind Erling Haaland’s substitution and when Manchester City can expect to welcome back their star centre-forward with a crucial run of matches looming.</p>

<p>“Twist in the ankle,” Pep Guardiola revealed on the subject of Erling Haaland and the problem that the 23-year-old had sustained. “We didn’t want to take risks with him, he didn’t feel comfortable. He’ll be back maybe Tuesday, but maybe next Sunday.”</p>

<p>Manchester City are returning to UEFA Champions League duties on Tuesday night as Swiss outfit BSC Young Boys visit the Etihad Stadium. Victory for the competition’s holders would see them progress to the knock-out stages with two games remaining.</p>

<p>As for next weekend, Manchester City travel to Stamford Bridge in the Premier League where they will be reunited with the likes of Cole Palmer and Raheem Sterling in the clash with Mauricio Pochettino’s Chelsea side.</p>
