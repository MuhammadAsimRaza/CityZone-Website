        <p>

            KDB=4 Peat??
            <br>
<br>
            Kevin De Bruyne's return to Manchester City in 2024 started with a bang! Ironically it only took “17” minutes for the midfield maestro to make his impact. While it may seem premature to discuss a player's return, De Bruyne's impact on City's success has been undeniable. His ability, consistency and influence on his teammates make him an invaluable asset for any team. As he made his way down the Turf Moor tunnel on opening night, there was a collective gasp when the sensational Belgium captain suffered an injury. So far, the Treble winners have been able to keep their heads above water despite that setback.
            <br>
<br>
<img class="article-image" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1150106517790527609/1196130998254063626/kdb2.png?ex=65b682cd&is=65a40dcd&hm=21429eed1b0493efc4ac830c68fc2b00244469ccce1a8a378ca6179d684343cd&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1035&height=580" alt="">
            Any side on the planet would miss KDB and the unique attributes he provides. However, even without the line-breaking forages and trademark assists, City have continued to do what they do best - win. KDB’s absence has undoubtedly affected Manchester City's performance, as his trademark assists are amongst the key elements of their attacking play. However, City's ability to continue winning shows the depth and quality of their squad, as they have been able to adapt and find other avenues for success. 
            <br>
<br>
            Nevertheless, his return in 2024 will still be a significant boost for the club, as his influence and ability to change games cannot be understated. Kevin’s return will not also only provide a significant boost to City but also reaffirm his status as one of the best players in the world. It’s Kevin’s personal goal to become the undisputed best player in the world too.
           <br>
<br> 
<img class="article-image" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1150106517790527609/1196125247552892990/image0.jpg?ex=65b67d71&is=65a40871&hm=df7bc718e9dbb6a1a6a1db9f90cd819a3d800e204c65289ca9d2d7573f3e72af&=&format=webp&width=957&height=662" alt="">
            His influence and ability to change games cannot be understated, and his presence on the field will undoubtedly elevate the team's performance to new heights. With KDB, Manchester City's win percentage has been an impressive 75% over the past three seasons, while without him, it drops to 60%. As a result of De Bruyne’s return to the squad, Erling Haaland, who is already the joint league leader in goals scored, will certainly increase his lead with the return of the Premier League's assist king.
            <br>
<br>
            There is nobody quite like De Bruyne available to Pep Guardiola right now and here are a few reasons as to why:
            <br>
            <br>
           1. Proven Quality
           <br>
<br>
           KDB’s return to Manchester City will be like signing a world-class player from scratch. Throughout his career, the Belgian has established himself as one of the most dangerous and creative midfielders in the world. His ability to break down defenses, create chances, and score goals makes him a constant threat on the field.
           <br>
<br>
           2. Consistency and Reliability
           <br>
<br>
           One of De Bruyne's qualities is his incredible consistency and reliability. He has consistently performed at an extremely high level, both domestically and internationally. His durability is also commendable. Kevin has risked his body for the squad. His presence in the starting eleven ensures stability, reliability, and high performance.
           <br>
<br>
           3. Leadership and Team Impact
           <br>
<br>
           Kev is not only an exceptional player but also a natural leader. He commands respect from his teammates and sets the tone on the pitch with his relentless work ethic and determination. His presence allows other players to thrive, as he provides guidance and inspiration. His ability to unlock defenses and score crucial goals makes him a game-changer for Manchester City.
           <br>
<br>

           4. Improved Team Chemistry
           <br>
<br>
           As KDB returns, he will reunite with a group of players who have formed a strong bond and chemistry over the years. This familiarity and trust will enhance the team's overall cohesion, allowing them to play more efficiently and effectively. The return of De Bruyne will create a ripple effect that will positively impact the entire squad. The return of the Premier League's assist king will surely boost morale like we saw against Huddersfield.
           <br>
<br>
           5. Building for the Future
           <br>
<br>
           KDB’s return to Manchester City in 2024 will be like signing a player for the future. Despite his age, the Belgian midfielder still has the potential to continue performing at an elite level for several years. His experience, leadership qualities, and ability to adapt to evolving football trends make him a valuable asset for the club's long-term ambitions.
           <br>
<br>
           Overall, KDB’s return is a positive for City, and his presence on the field will undoubtedly be felt by the team and its fans as he looks to become one of the greatest midfielders to ever play football. In just his first Premier League game back Kevin took City from 2-1 down to a 3-2 win seeing him provide a goal and an assist. KDB’s impact is immense!
