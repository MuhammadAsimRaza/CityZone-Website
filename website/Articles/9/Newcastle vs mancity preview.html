        <p>
<b>Manchester City look to get off to a winning start in Premier League play for 2024 as they travel to St. Jamesâ€™ Park on Saturday evening.
</b>
<br>
<br>

The Quintuple winners enter the weekend fresh off a 5-0 hammering of Huddersfield Town in the third round of the Emirates FA Cup, spearheaded by two Phil Foden goals, a Jeremy Doku goal, a Julian Alvarez goal and an assist on return for Kevin De Bruyne.
<br>
<br>

City have re-gained some consistency in the league of late; the Blues had only one win in six between the middle of November and December, but have won their last three domestic games - two of which in league play.
<br>
<br>
Newcastle United find themselves ninth in the Premier League table, something of a surprise given their fourth-placed finish and Champions League qualification last season. They've lost their last 3 games in the league (1-0, Luton [A], 1-3, Nottingham Forest [H], 4-2, Liverpool [A]), though they also advanced in the FA Cup at the expense of bitter rivals Sunderland (0-3) in the third round.
<br>
<br>
<b>Head-to-head</b>
<br>
<br>
City have only lost twice to the Magpies under the reign of Pep Guardiola, with one of those being a Premier League defeat (2-1, 29/01/2019; 1-0, 27/09/2023). The Blues have won 4 of the last 5 in the league against Newcastle.

<b>Where to Watch</b>
<br>
<br>
Newcastle United v Manchester City will kick-off at 17:30 UK time, and can be viewed on TNT Sports.
<br>
<br>
<b>Team News</b>
<br>
<br>
Pep Guardiola during his press conference confirmed that Erling Haaland and John Stones will not feature on Tyneside. He has hinted at Kevin De Bruyne making a return to the Starting XI. 
<br>
<br>
Newcastle have a plethora of absentees. They have had a lot of injuries, leading to a lacklustre league campaign. Noteworthy absentees include Nick Pope, Joelinton, Callum Wilson, Sandro Tonali (suspended), etc.
<br>
<br>

<b>Score Prediction
</b><br>
<br>
Manchester City have fewer absentees and even without them. Newcastle are still a good side, potentially good enough to cause some problems.
<br>
<br>
<b>Newcastle United 1-2 Manchester City.
</b>
