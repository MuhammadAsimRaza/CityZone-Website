        <p>
<b>Manchester City are due to begin their defence of the FA Cup in the third round vs Championship side Huddersfield Town.</b>
<br>
<br>
The Blues enter the competition as holders thanks to a 2-1 win vs local nemesis Manchester United at Wembley Stadium, the second-leg of a historic Treble.
<br>
<br>
Fresh off being crowned Champions of the World, the Blues have gotten back to form domestically, securing a come-from-behind 1-3 win at Everton, before securing a 2-0 win vs basement-dwelling Sheffield United, following goals from Rodri and Julian Alvarez.
<br>
<br>
The Terriers come in sat in a relegation battle in the Championship. They're 21st in their division, and have won two of their last ten games.
<br>
<br>

<b>Head-to-head</b>
<br>
<br>
City hasn't lost to Huddersfield in this millennium. The last Terriers win was in November 1999, a 0-1 result at Maine Road. The Blues have won four of the last five meetings between the two.
<br>
<br>
<b>Where to Watch</b>
<br>
<br>
Viewers in the UK can watch this 14:00 GMT kick-off on the BBC Red Button.
<br>
<br>

<b>Team News</b>
<br>
<br>

Pep Guardiola's men have received three fitness boosts, as Jeremy Doku, Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne are all back in full training, with De Bruyne a contender to get minutes following his appearance on the bench vs Sheffield United. 
<br>
<br>

Huddersfield Town will be without Japanese international Yuta Nakayama as he departs for the Asian Cup.
<br>
<br>

<b>Score Prediction</b>
<br>
<br>

With more returnees to the Manchester City squad coupled with the match being at Etihad Stadium, a place City haven't suffered defeat for more than a year, it's difficult to see a Huddersfield victory.
<br>
<br>

<b>Manchester City 4-0 Huddersfield Town.</b>
