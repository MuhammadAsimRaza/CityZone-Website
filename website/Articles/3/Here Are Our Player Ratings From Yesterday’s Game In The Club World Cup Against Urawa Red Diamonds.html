        <p> Ederson - 6: Didn't have too much to do; almost lost the ball early on in his own penalty area.
            <br>
            <br>

Nathan Ake - 6.5: In general, very good. Was always making himself an option in possession and did well with it.
<br>
<br>
Manuel Akanji - 6: Generally good despite his yellow card in the first-half.
<br>
<br>
John Stones - 6.5: Did his usual part in possession; moved the ball around well in final-third.
<br>
<br>
Kyle Walker - 6.5: Had Ederson in trouble a few times with his passes, but much improved from previous games and provided a quality assist.
<br>
<br> 

Rodri - 7: Did his thing; almost never gave the ball away, threatened from distance a couple of times.
<br>
<br>

Mateo Kovacic - 6.5: Didn't look too comfortable in the first-half, but improved in the second-half and took his chance well.
<br>
<br>
Matheus Nunes - 7.5 [MOTM]: Created the opening goal by driving through midfield; often times the focal point in the attack, and was really effective in doing so.
<br>
<br>

Bernardo Silva - 7: Scored a somewhat lucky goal in the second-half, but was good in keeping the ball and moving it.
<br>
<br>

Jack Grealish - 5.5: Made bad decisions in front of goal, didn't do too much when he pushed the ball forward.
<br>
<br>
Phil Foden - 6.5: Had decent creativity in the first-half.
<br>
<br>
<b>Substitutes</b>
<br>
<br>
Oscar Bobb - 6.5: Caused problems for the defence when he had the ball.
<br>
<br>
Julian Alvarez - 6: Had some opportunities to score.
<br>
<br>
Josko Gvardiol - 6: Defended well; had a good run into the box.
<br>
<br>
Sergio Gomez - 5.5: Didn't really impact the game.
<br>
<br>
Kalvin Phillips - 6: Narrowly missed out on scoring a goal, but didn't do too much otherwise.</p>
