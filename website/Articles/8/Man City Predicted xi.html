        <p>
<b>Manchester City are set to begin the defence of their Emirates FA Cup crown in the third-round vs Championship opposition Huddersfield Town.</b>
<br>
<br>
With Pep Guardiola announcing news on nine players in his preview of the game, here's how we think the Blues will start their clash with The Terriers:
<br>
<br>
Pep Guardiola is known to rotate his goalkeepers for domestic cup matches. <b>Stefan Ortega</b> started all Carabao Cup and FA Cup fixtures last season, and we expect him to get the nod between the sticks.
        <img class="article-image" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1150106517790527609/1192993786683465728/IMG_1170.jpg?ex=65ab190b&is=6598a40b&hm=3cb12a253ddab2d02b5461451e2c974625f1614ccb0111800e5c954e1c43b4ae&" alt="">

<br>
<br>
<b>Kyle Walker</b> has been a mainstay in the team this season, and missed only one FA Cup match last season. It's likely the experience full-back continues to be a regular for this clash.
<br>
<br>
With John Stones out due to injury, <b>Manuel Akanji</b> will more than likely have his chance to shine.
<br>
<br>
<b>Nathan Ake</b> will be expected to partner the Swiss international in defence.
<br>
<br>
Cup ties like this are the perfect opportunities for young players, and <b>Rico Lewis</b> - while young - is also quickly becoming a regular member for the Blues.
<br>
<br>
With news of Kalvin Phillips being sick, and the need to give Rodri rest for more important games ahead,<b> Mateo Kovacic</b> will more than likely be slotted into a defensive midfield role.
<br>
<br>
<b>Bernardo Silva</b> is our pick to start next to the Croatian international.
        <img class="article-image" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1150106517790527609/1192995564439208077/IMG_1174.jpg?ex=65ab1ab3&is=6598a5b3&hm=0ece837992679b799b69f086022c6059d3bdca667ca98af4643580c05ce3dbed&=&format=webp&width=716&height=477" alt="">


<br>
<b>Phil Foden</b> has been the difference maker for City of late, and we think he'll be picked to build on his outstanding form.
<br>
<br>
As aforementioned, young players often get a perfect opportunity to shine in cup ties like these. <b>Oscar Bobb</b> has been praised repeatedly by Pep Guardiola, so we expect he will get a chance to earn more here.
<br>
<br>
Erling Haaland has just come back to training with the full squad, so we expect Pep Guardiola to start <b>Julian Alvarez</b> instead of risking the Norwegian.

<br>

<b>Jack Grealish</b> should round off the XI for Sundayâ€™s match.

<br>
<br>
<b>Predicted XI:</b> Ortega; Walker, Akanji, Ake, Lewis; Kovacic, Bernardo, Foden; Bobb, Alvarez, Grealish
