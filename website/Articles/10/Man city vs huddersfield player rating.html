        <p>

<b>Manchester City began the defence of their FA Cup crown in comfortable fashion, with a 5-0 victory over Huddersfield Town in the third round.
</b>
<br>
<br>
It looked like vintage City under Pep Guardiola, as the Blues looked back to their best with a superb display from just about everyone.
<br>
<br>
Phil Foden bagged himself two goals in what was yet another outstanding performance, something we've become used to from him. Julian Alvarez and Jeremy Doku also got their names on the scoresheet. 

<br>
<br>
Kevin De Bruyne also made his return to action for Manchester City, having been out with injury since the opening night of the Premier League season at Burnley.
<br>
<br>
Here's our judgement of every individual performance from a memorable FA Cup third round:
<br>
<br>
<b>Stefan Ortega</b> - 7.5: Two excellent saves when needed; did well to snuff out any Huddersfield chances before they got dangerous.
<br>
<br>
<b><b>Manuel Akanji </b>- 7.5:</b> Played a super diagonal pass to Jack Grealish to create one of City’s first chances; looked really good with his passing.
 <br>
<br>
<b>Ruben Dias</b> - 8:</b>Excellent with the ball; another good performance following a shaky spell during the holiday period.
<br>
<br>
<b>Josko Gvardiol - 6.5:</b> Almost made a costly giveaway leading to a Huddersfield goal.
<br>
<br>
<b>Sergio Gomez - 7:</b> Not too involved, but looked good when he got on the ball.
<br>
<br>
<b>Rico Lewis - 7.5:</b> Another standard performance, even with Akanji’s early exit.
<br>
<br>
<b>Mateo Kovacic - 8:</b> Held his own as the lone 6 filling in for Rodri; assisted Foden’s second goal, helped setting up the dink from Oscar Bobb for the third goal.
<br>
<br>
<b>Oscar Bobb - 8: </b>A super display from the Norwegian international, even with match time coming at a premium.
<br>
<br>
<b>Phil Foden - 9.5 [MOTM]:</b> Wow, wow, wow. What else can we say? He was quiet in the opening 20 minutes when Huddersfield were difficult to break down, but he made his brilliance show when he was on the ball more.

<br>
<br>
<b>Jack Grealish - 7: </b>Not too involved since most of the attacks were on the other side of the pitch.
<br>
<br>
<b>Julian Alvarez - 8.5:</b> Shined once City broke down the Huddersfield low block.
        <img class="article-image" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1150106517790527609/1194041394210275398/47d7cb11-327c-4f33-ad60-52e155c00ab9.jpg?ex=65aee8b4&is=659c73b4&hm=0c7fd4b59229ea512a53063c72eb436e322bd24f2c0ebc7f5a928e98eea3228e&" alt="">

<br>
<br>
<b>Substitutes:</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Matheus Nunes - 7.5: </b>He's not a player suited to having to break down a low block, but you wouldn't think so with his performance, even after his was more abrupt than expected.
<br>
<br>
<b>Kevin De Bruyne - 7.5: </b>He showed he was truly back and ready; took just 17 minutes for his first assist.

<br>

<br>
<b>Jeremy Doku - 7.5:</b> Took his goal well; continues to be good competition for Jack Grealish.

<br>
<br>
<b>Jacob Wright</b> - Didn't impact the game much.
<br>
<br>
<b>Micah Hamilton</b> - Didn't impact the game much.
