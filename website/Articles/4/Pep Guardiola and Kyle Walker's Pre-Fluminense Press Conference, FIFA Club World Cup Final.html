        <p> <b>Pep Guardiola and Kyle Walker were in front of the media ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup Final vs Fluminense.</b>
<br>
<br>
The Blues are in the showpiece fixture of the Club World Cup following a cruise-controlled 0-3 win vs Asian Champions Urawa Red Diamonds in the Semi-Final.
<br>
<br>
That leaves the European Champions 90 minutes away from being able to claim the title of ‘Champions of the World’. Standing in their way are recent Copa Libertadores Champions, Fluminense.
<br>
<br>
The final presents the Treble winners the opportunity to be the holders of five separate trophies - the Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League, UEFA Super League and the Club World Cup - a feat never achieved before by any English side.
<br>

Ahead of the final, Pep Guardiola and captain Kyle Walker discussed multiple topics. We have every word from their press conference.
<br>
<br>
<b>Pep Guardiola on comments from the press about Fluminense:</b>
<br>
<br>
“I’m not going to talk for one second about what the press said about tomorrow’s game. I know Fluminense’s talent and how much this competition means for South American teams.
<br>
<br>
“They have beaten teams from Argentina, Colombia and Uruguay. I know my players and respect Fluminense for what they do.”
<br>
<br>

<b>Pep Guardiola on Fluminense's experience: </b>
<br>
<br>
“Fluminense has six/seven players over 30-years-old; they know how to control their emotions. They play in a very Brazilian wat from the 70s, 80s, exchanges of passes, lots of players where the ball is… We need to stay aware of the spaces we will have.
<br>
<br>
“The way they play, we've never faced a team like that. It's not positional, they move a lot. We have to impose ourselves in the best way possible.”
<br>
<br>
<b>Pep Guardiola on playing the final without emotion:</b>
<br>
<br>
<img class="article-image" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1150106517790527609/1187429123153465425/IMG_0846.jpg?ex=6596da8c&is=6584658c&hm=677d1fc83ab377c22006c913c7fa6ad96c03077b51d33eed40c6aa3a7538c25a&" alt="">

“How do you play a Club World Cup final without emotion? Emotion is there, it's how you handle it. It's there. It's how long it stays in your mind. That's the biggest target in finals.”
<br>
<br>
<b>Kyle Walker on winning the Club World Cup:</b>
<br>
<br>
“For me, it means putting Manchester City where it wants to be. It's because of the fans who went to Maine Road, who go to the Etihad. It's for them.
<br>
<br>
“It would top off what we did last season, winning the Treble as a group of lads that have spent a lot of years together working towards the right direction. It would be on par with one of the greatest achievements.”
<br>
<br>
<b>Kyle Walker on his critics pointing to his age: </b>
<br>
<br>
“Age is just a number to me. What matters is your performance. From what I saw of Marcelo - one of the best left-backs in the history of football - he is still at a good level. And comments like that are a little disrespectful.”
<br>

<b>Kyle Walker on whether winning the Club World Cup would be the best moment of his career:</b>
<br>
<br>
“I don't know if it will be the best moment of my career, because I've already won a lot of incredible things here. But it will be the icing on the cake. It will be among the greatest achievements.”
