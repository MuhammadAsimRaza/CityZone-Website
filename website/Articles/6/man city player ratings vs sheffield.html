        <p>
Here are our Player Ratings from a comfortable evening at an Etihad Stadium that saw no visitors able to win throughout 2023.
<br>
<br>

<b>Ederson</b> - 7: Had one save to make in the game; flawless distribution again.
<br>
<br>
<b>Josko Gvardiol</b> - 6.5: Not the best decision-making when on the ball, but recovered well each time.
<br>
<br>
<b>Nathan Ake</b> - 7.5: A standardly great performance, as he mopped up whenever Sheffield United looked for their long ball in-behind.
<br>
<br>
<b>Manuel Akanji </b>- 7.5: Showcased great ability on the ball, which will be necessary with John Stones out with injury.
<br>
<br>
<b>Kyle Walker</b> - 6.5: Average performance; some shots from 30+ yards that never looked threatening.
<br>
<br>
<b>Rodri</b> - 8.5: Well taken goal; dictated play in the middle like how we've been used to.
<img class="article-image" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1150106517790527609/1190726231163928606/GetPaidStock.png?ex=65a2d938&is=65906438&hm=1a67ec58e8ba2f7a647360f191bde05158942ca1559c1b99e08332c30922e52d&" alt="">

<br>
<br>
<b>Mateo Kovacic</b> - 6: Sloppy on the ball a few times, one of which leading to his booking in the first-half.
<br>
<br>
<b>Phil Foden</b> - 9.5 [MOTM]: *Another* outstanding display; constantly threatened on the ball; assisted both goals.

<br>
<br>
<b>Jack Grealish</b> - 6.5: Understandably average performance, given recent personal events; limped off when substituted, hopefully not an injury.
<br>
<br>
<b>Julian Alvarez </b>- 8: Great pressing from the Argentine; scored a goal and looked great on the ball.
<img class="article-image" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1150106517790527609/1190726686422093914/GetPaidStock.png?ex=65a2d9a4&is=659064a4&hm=1be1a55aa0ad1a48b58be8aab3e1f8d92cce75903ac348ef7062b760134e3f50&" alt="">

<br>
<br>
<b>Bernardo Silva</b> - 6.5: Didn't do much; could've taken his chance better in the first-half.
<br>
<br>
<b>Subsitutes:</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Oscar Bobb</b> - 7: Fantastic cameo; helped setup the second goal; looked good on the ball.
<br>
<br>
<b>Rico Lewis</b> - 6.5: Brought more control once he replaced Mateo Kovacic.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ruben Dias</b> - 6.5: Been dropped recently, but this performance was better than a lot of his recent performances.
